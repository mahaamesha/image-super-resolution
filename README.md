## About <a name = "about"></a>

In the oil and gas industry, there is a problem, namely measuring the pore width of rock from micro CT scan output images requires high resolution images, and this is very time consuming and expensive. GANs can be a solution to this problem. High resolution images and their details can be obtained from the input in the form of low resolution images.
